1. Download and deploy a Nutch installation. This part is covered in Nutch's 
documentation.

Once you're able to access Nutch via your favorite Web browser, you're set to 
add a Carrot2 adapter.

2. Build the adapter, you should find a JAR file in tmp/dist directory:

carrot2-adapter-nutch.jar

3. Copy the adapter JAR to Nutch's deployment folder substituting "DEPLOYED-
NUTCH-DIR" a path that matches your local configuration.

${DEPLOYED-NUTCH-DIR}/WEB-INF/lib

4. Add and configure Carrot2 adapter servlet by adding the following section to 
Nutch's web application deployment file (${DEPLOYED-NUTCH-DIR}/WEB-INF/web.xml):


<!-- Carrot2 Input Component Servlet -->
<servlet>
    <servlet-name>Nutch-Carrot2 adapter servlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>com.dawidweiss.carrot.input.nutch.NutchToCarrot2Servlet</servlet-class>
</servlet>

<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>Nutch-Carrot2 adapter servlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/carrot2</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
<!-- EOF: Carrot2 Input Component Servlet -->


NOTE: The web.xml file has a strictly defined order of defined elements (in a 
DTD file). At the time of writing, you should place this section immediately 
after the start of 'web-app' element and before 'welcome-file-list'. If 
uncertain, use a validating XML editor like JEdit (www.jedit.org).
