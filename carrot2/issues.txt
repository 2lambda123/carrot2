Massimo Miccoli reports:

Users of  Debian Woody distribution and Tomcat4  must give write permission
to tomcat4 users on  /var/lib/tomcat4/webapps
so Carrot2 can work.  Is not a  true solution for security reason, but it
work.

Tomcat 4.1.10

OK, I did some search my self and I made it work. The problem is that 
somehow my Tomcat can not work with xercesImpl.jar which I put in 
WEB-INF/lib of carrot web app. I removed it, so that Tomcat could use 
its own xml parser.
