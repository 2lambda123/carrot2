A roadmap to release 1.0.1
------------------------

- Fix word-wrapping bug in the results tree (xsltrenderer) - place a
  non-breakable space between the last word of the cluster's label and the
  number of documents in that cluster (example:
  http://www.carrot2.org/resources/word-breaking.png)

- Fix layout problems with very long URL. "overflow: hidden" CSS property may
  turn out helpful here.
