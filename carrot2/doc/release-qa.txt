Quality Assurance [before a release]
-----------------

- Make sure the local checkout is in sync with the server:

	cvs -q -n -z3 up            (nothing should be printed)


- Go to carrot root checkout and issue the following:

	ant license                 (commit and repeat if license files have been saved)

	ant -q cleanall clean

	ant -q test                 (all tests must pass)
	
	ant -q build remote         (remote and local applications must build)

	ant javadoc                 (no fatal errors)


- Create a distribution for final testing, replacing "VERSION" with real release number.

	ant -q -Drelease.number=VERSION dist


- Try the local application

	cd dist
	unzip *local*.zip
	demo.bat (or demo.sh)       (make sure it launches properly)


- Deploy remote applications on a clean Tomcat server, see if they work.
