This folder contains a docbook XSL stylesheets distribution used to render
Carrot2 documentation. Because docbook will be updated rarely, and to save some CVS space,
it is distributed as a ZIP file that is automatically uncompressed when building the manual.

DO NOT ALTER ANY UNCOMPRESSED FILES - they can be overwritten at any time by the build script.
