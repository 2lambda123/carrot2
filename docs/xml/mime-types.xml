    &carrot; component descriptors used to include information about <acronym>MIME</acronym> types
    of the data streams accepted and produced by the component. This specification
    has been dropped because it was not used by any of the component writers. However,
    we retained the file format specifications even if they cannot be verified at
    runtime.

    restricted to the list below (which is apt to be extended or modified according to our needs
    anyway).
