    <title><acronym>MIME</acronym> types and data stream formats in &carrot;</title>

    <para>
    &carrot; component descriptors may include information about <acronym>MIME</acronym> types
    of the data streams accepted and produced by the component. This information is useful
    for detecting illegal combinations of components in a processing chain, but is not obligatory.
    Several <acronym>MIME</acronym> types defined for data exchange in &carrot; are presented
    in this chapter. Please note that components may support other data formats, not necessarily
    restricted to the list below (which is apt to be extended or modified according to our needs
    anyway).
