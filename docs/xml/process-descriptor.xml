    <title>Process descriptor</title>

    <para>
    A process descriptor file describes how users requests are handled by the controller component.
    The controller component should somehow interpret the <emphasis>textual query</emphasis>, such as
    <userinput>ice cream recipe</userinput>, and redirect it to an input component, then process intermediate
    result using filter components and finally display the result of processing to the user. <emphasis>How</emphasis>
    this flow is achieved is defined in the process descriptor file.
    </para>
    
    <para>
    The process descriptor is an XML file, which specifies 
    a script (usually in &beanshell;),
    which gets executed in response to
    each query and takes full control over the process of request processing.

        <title>Required elements of a process descriptor</title>
        
        <para>
        Every process descriptor must contain the obligatory <sgmltag>process</sgmltag>
        element, which specifies its <sgmltag>id</sgmltag>. The identification string of a process
        is assigned by &carrot; project maintainer (because it is also used for assigning a
        locale-sensitive name).
        </para>
        
        <para>
        The main part of a process descriptor consists of specification of how components are applied to the
        user request in order to produce certain output. This specification is
        expressed in &beanshell; code (see <xref linkend="sect:processing-script" /> for 
        an example).
        </para>

    <section id="sect:processing-script">
        <title>Processing scripts</title>
        
        <para>
        <emphasis>Active</emphasis> specification of how requests should be handled can be given in the form
        of a <emphasis>script</emphasis>. This script can be written in any language supported by the BSF project
        (Bean Scripting Framework), in particular a Java-like scripting language BeanShell or JavaScript.  
        </para>
        
        <para>
        The script has access to several global objects, which describe the current processing environment and
        user request. Namely, <varname>query</varname> object contains the user query and <varname>controller</varname>
        object allows the script to invoke processing using &carrot; components. Please consult examples 
        present in the &cvs; for details.
