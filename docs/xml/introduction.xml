        <title>What is &carrot;?</title>
        
        <para>
        &carrot; is a research framework for experimenting with automated querying of
        various data sources (such as search engines), processing search results and
        their visualization.

        <para>
        Under the term &quot;research&quot;, we understand that the architecture
        of the system is oriented mostly toward flexibility, sometimes at
        a price of performance. Mechanisms such as
        data exchange via XML language, distributed,
        dynamically accessible components, the use of Java as primary language
        of implementation &ndash; they all make the system quite easy to tailor
        to one's needs.
        </para>
        
        <para>
        &carrot; was primarily built with search results clustering in mind, but it can
        be configured or adjusted to do other kinds of pipelined data processing.
