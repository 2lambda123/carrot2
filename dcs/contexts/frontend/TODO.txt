Workbench:

* query and non-query data sources
  - for spreadsheet and JSON input, use document display settings per "schema"?
  - a creator for configuring Solr and ES as data source?
* customization of clustering dictionaries
* export of clusters and documents as CSV?
* visualization coloring by document attributes
* we need to note that the user's data will be sent to our server for clustering.
  Data will not be stored on the server.
* Solr/ES without CORS: paste response in a text box / support Solr/ES as files?

Workbench workflow:

* Carrot2 XML: we process the file right away
* Excel/CSV/JSON: we process all text fields we find in the file, allow configuration afterwards
* Solr/ES: initial configuration of the service on the welcome screen (quick ping if the service works), initial query
* Public search engines: provide initial query box on the welcome screen

First release:

* file input:
  * accept only allowed file types
  * format documentation and examples?
* clustering language selection
* Pass query hint to algorithms
* Parameter section folding
* Auto run clustering on setting change
* export of parameters JSON for pasting into code
* tuning of stopwords (Lingo3G)
* Custom document renderer: display of URL-typed fields
* Hide data source and algorithm combo boxes to make space for settings

Later:

* tuning of labels (label set comparison)


Refactoring:


Later:
* Limit the number of results displayed at once?
* Check background color on Circles export when implemented.
* Copy/save results as CSV
* Single document preview
* Mobile version
* Close popovers on Esc (should work, might be a BlueprintJS bug)
* Polish numeric inputs (min/max, enforce on keyboard input, NaN when typing "-")
* Error handling
  * Option to copy error message to clipboard


Performance:
* Changing source or cluster view re-renders the whole application.
  Check if this can be reasonably contained to the actual components involved.
