Features:
* Resize visualizations on window resize
* PubMed document source
* Error handling
  * Per-source messages (IP banned exception for eTools, for example)
* For each document, list the clusters the document belongs to.
  Clicking on the cluster reference should select the cluster.

Performance:
* Update visualizations only when they are visible?

  Check if this can be reasonably contained to the actual components involved.
