Features:
* Verify maxResults implementation in PubMed
* Close popovers on Esc
* Switching clustering algorithm
* Parse site: qualifier in eTools and pass to the eTools API
* Pass query to the clustering engine
* Error handling
  * Per-source messages (IP banned exception for eTools, for example)
* Save visualization as image
* Copy/save results as CSV
* Put query in HTML document title
* For each document, list the clusters the document belongs to.
  Clicking on the cluster reference should select the cluster.

* Limit the number of results displayed at once?
* Mobile version


Performance:
* Move querying and parsing source results to a web worker?
* Changing source or cluster view re-renders the whole application.
  Check if this can be reasonably contained to the actual components involved.
* Add code splitting, prefetching.
* Per-source document renderers (code splitting?).
* Choose theme based on dark-mode media query.
