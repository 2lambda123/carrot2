Features:
* For each document, list the clusters the document belongs to.
  Clicking on the cluster reference should select the cluster.
* Option to highlight clusters to which the hovered-on document belongs.
* Error handling
  * Per-source messages (IP banned exception for eTools, for example)


Performance:
* Changing source or cluster view re-renders the whole application.
  Check if this can be reasonably contained to the actual components involved.
* Add code splitting.
* Per-source document renderers (code splitting?).
* Choose theme based on dark-mode media query.
