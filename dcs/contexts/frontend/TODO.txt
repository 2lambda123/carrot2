Features:
* Limit title length displayed in visualizations, display full on hover?
* Parse site: qualifier in eTools and pass to the eTools API
* Pass query to the clustering engine
* Error handling
  * Option to copy error message to clipboard
* Message for IE users

Build & deployment:
* build customized Lingo3G distribution
* support for combined deployment: frontend served from CDN, clustering on our VPS
  (the frontend needs to come with an absolute DCS service URL compiled in)

Later:
* Limit the number of results displayed at once?
* Check background color on Circles export when implemented.
* Copy/save results as CSV
* Single document preview
* Mobile version
* Clean up configuration code.
* Close popovers on Esc (should work, might be a BlueprintJS bug)
* Polish numeric inputs (min/max, enforce on keyboard input, NaN when typing "-")


Performance:
* Changing source or cluster view re-renders the whole application.
  Check if this can be reasonably contained to the actual components involved.
* Choose theme based on dark-mode media query.
