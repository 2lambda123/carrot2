    <h2>Desirable characteristics of documents for clustering</h2>

    <p>
      The quality of clusters and their labels largely depends on the
      characteristics of documents provided on the input. Although there is no
      general rule for optimum document content, below are some tips worth
      considering.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Carrot<sup>2</sup> is designed for small to medium collections
            of documents</strong>. Carrot<sup>2</sup> algorithms perform in-memory
          clustering. For this reason, as a rule of thumb, Carrot<sup>2</sup>
          should successfully deal with up to a thousand of documents, a few
          paragraphs each. For algorithms designed to process millions of
          documents, check out the Mahout project or Carrot Search Lingo4G.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Provide a minimum of 20 documents</strong>. Carrot<sup>2</sup>
          clustering algorithms will work best with a set of documents similar
          to what is normally returned by a typical search engine. While about
          20 is the minimum number of documents you can reasonably cluster, the
          optimum would fall in the 100 &ndash; 500 range.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Provide contextual snippets if possible</strong>. If the input
          documents are a result of some search query, provide contextual
          snippets related to that query, similar to what web search engines
          return, instead of full document content. Not only will this speed up
          processing, but also should help the clustering algorithm to cover the
          full spectrum of topics dealt with in the search results.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Minimize "noise" in the input documents</strong>. All kinds of "noise" in the
          documents, such as truncated sentences (sometimes resulting from contextual
          snippet extraction suggested above) or random alphanumerical strings may
          decrease the quality of cluster labels. If you have access to e.g. a few
          sentences' abstract of each document, it is worth checking the quality of
          clustering based on those abstracts. Extracting complete sentences
          matching user's query should improve the clusters even further.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Let us once again stress that there are no definite generic guidelines for
      the best content for clustering, it is always worth experimenting with
      different combinations. You can also describe your specific application on
      Carrot<sup>2</sup> mailing list and ask for advice.
