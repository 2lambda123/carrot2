    <h2>Desirable characteristics of input documents</h2>

    <p>
      The quality of clusters and their labels largely depends on the
      quality of documents provided on the input. Although there is no
      general rule for optimum document content, below are some tips worth
      considering.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Carrot<sup>2</sup> is designed for small to medium collections
            of documents</strong>. Carrot<sup>2</sup> algorithms perform in-memory
          clustering. For this reason, as a rule of thumb, Carrot<sup>2</sup>
          should successfully deal with up to a thousand of documents, a few
          paragraphs each. For algorithms designed to process millions of
          documents, check out <a href="https://mahout.apache.org/">the Apache Mahout project</a>
          or <a href="https://carrotsearch.com/lingo4g/">Carrot Search Lingo4G</a>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Provide a minimum of 100 documents</strong>. Carrot<sup>2</sup>
          clustering algorithms work better with increasing amount of data. A hundred
          documents on input is probably the minimum for any statistical significance
          of features discovered by the algorithm. In general, an optimum number
          of documents would probably fall between 100 and a few thousands.
          More than that may cause problems due to in-memory processing.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Provide query-context snippets instead of entire documents</strong>.
          If the input
          documents are a result of some search query, provide contextual
          snippets related to that query (similar to what web search engines
          return), instead of full document content. Not only will this speed up
          processing, but should also guide the clustering algorithm to discover
          query-related spectrum of topics.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Minimize noise in the input documents</strong>. All kinds of noisy
          fragments in the input like truncated sentences, random alphanumerical strings
          or repeated boilerplate may decrease the quality of cluster labels.
          If you are extracting query context for clustering, retrieving complete sentences
          instead of truncated fragments should improve cluster labels even further.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Choosing the clustering algorithm</h2>

    <p>
      Carrot<sup>2</sup> offers <a href="algorithms.html">several clustering algorithms</a>.
      These algorithms differ in algorithmic approaches to solving the problem and vary in
      performance characteristics and in how they find and then label document clusters.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's quite difficult to give one clear recommendation as to which algorithm is
      "the best": the decision is a problem of weighing multiple criteria such as performance or cluster
      label legibility. Compare the following three sets of cluster labels acquired for the
      same input using different algorithms:

          The same input ("data mining" search results) clustered with three different clustering
          algorithms.

      Many people (including us) have a subjective feeling that the Lingo-family of algorithms
      (<a href="algorithms.html#lingo">Lingo</a> and
      <a href="algorithms.html#lingo3g">Lingo3G</a>) delivers more intuitive and diverse clusters
      compared to other algorithms.
      Sometimes it is other characteristics, such as performance or cluster structure, that should be
      taken into account.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following table summarizes key characteristics of each algorithm shipped in
      Carrot<sup>2</sup>.

    <p class="warning">
      <a href="algorithms.html#lingo3g">Lingo3G</a>, the commercial algorithm that plugs into
      Carrot<sup>2</sup> has a <a href="https://carrotsearch.com/lingo3g/comparison/">separate
      page</a> where its features are compared against the open source algorithms.

    <p>
      While the table above can be useful to determine which algorithm to choose,
      the ultimate judgment should be based on an empirical evaluation with your specific document
      collection.

    <h2>Tweaking parameters</h2>

    <p>
      The default settings that come with each algorithm are good for an average case. Each
      algorithm comes with a number of attributes which can be used to tune its output and
      runtime characteristics.
      You can easily <a href="java-api-basics.html#tweaking-attributes">adjust attributes in Java API</a>.
      An robust way to <a href="rest-api-basics.html#models">override attributes in REST API</a>
      is to use request model classes.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to achieve good cluster labels and high clustering quality it is vital
      to <strong>adjust the default language resources</strong> so that they exclude any common
      terms, phrases and expressions specific to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>the selected language (the default resources should contain a reasonable number of these
        already),
      </li>
      <li>the domain of documents being clustered.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For example, if clustering documents from the medical domain, certain expressions and terms
      may be obvious and trivial to the domain. Forming clusters out of these wouldn't be of any
      value to the users. By excluding such expressions the algorithms are guided to look for other,
      perhaps more interesting alternative content.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lexical resources can be adjusted both in the
      <a href="java-language-components.html#tweaking-lexical-data-resources">Java API</a>
      and in the
      <a href="dcs-language-components.html">REST API</a>.
