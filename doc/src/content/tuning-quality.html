    This article discusses approaches to tuning Carrot<sup>2</sup> clustering
    algorithms.

    <h2>Desirable characteristics of input documents</h2>

    <p>
      The quality of clusters and their labels largely depends on the
      quality of documents provided on the input. Although there is no
      general rule for optimum document content, below are some tips worth
      considering.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Carrot<sup>2</sup> is designed for small to medium collections
            of documents</strong>. Carrot<sup>2</sup> algorithms perform in-memory
          clustering. For this reason, as a rule of thumb, Carrot<sup>2</sup>
          should successfully deal with up to a thousand of documents, a few
          paragraphs each. For algorithms designed to process millions of
          documents, check out <a href="https://mahout.apache.org/">the Apache Mahout project</a>
          or <a href="https://carrotsearch.com/lingo4g/">Carrot Search Lingo4G</a>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Provide a minimum of 100 documents</strong>. Carrot<sup>2</sup>
          clustering algorithms work better with increasing amount of data. A hundred
          documents on input is probably the minimum for any statistical significance
          of features discovered by the algorithm. In general, an optimum number
          of documents would probably fall between 100 and a few thousands.
          More than that may cause problems due to in-memory processing.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Provide query-context snippets instead of entire documents</strong>.
          If the input
          documents are a result of some search query, provide contextual
          snippets related to that query (similar to what web search engines
          return), instead of full document content. Not only will this speed up
          processing, but should also guide the clustering algorithm to discover
          query-related spectrum of topics.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Minimize noise in the input documents</strong>. All kinds of noisy
          fragments in the input like truncated sentences, random alphanumerical strings
          or repeated boilerplate may decrease the quality of cluster labels.
          If you are extracting query context for clustering, retrieving complete sentences
          instead of truncated fragments should improve cluster labels even further.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tweaking parameters</h2>

    <p>
      The default settings that come with each algorithm are good for an average case. Each
      clustering algorithm comes with a number of parameters which can be used to tune its output and
      runtime characteristics.
      You can easily <a href="java-api-basics.html#tweaking-attributes">adjust them in Java API</a>.
      A robust way to override them in the REST API<a href="rest-api-basics.html#models">
      is to use request model classes</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to achieve good cluster labels and high clustering quality it is vital
      to <strong>adjust the default language resources</strong> so that they exclude any common
      terms, phrases and expressions specific to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>the selected language (the default resources should contain a reasonable number of these
        already),
      </li>
      <li>the domain of documents being clustered.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For example, if clustering documents from the medical domain, certain expressions and terms
      may be obvious and trivial to the domain. Forming clusters out of these wouldn't be of any
      value to the users. By excluding such expressions the algorithms are guided to look for other,
      perhaps more interesting alternative content.
    </p>

    <p>
      Language resources can be adjusted in many ways. See the relevant
      bits of documentation in the <a href="java-language-components.html">Java API</a>,
      the <a href="dcs-language-components.html">REST API</a> and syntax
      overview of <a href="dictionaries.html">the default dictionaries</a>.
