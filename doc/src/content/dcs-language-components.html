  <h1>Language Components</h1>

  <p>
    In this section we describe means to tune the language component resources in the
    REST API (DCS).
  </p>

  <p>
    The Java API <a href="java-language-components.html">language components section</a>
    already introduced the role and importance of tuning language components properly. It also
    introduced standard conventions for naming stop word resources and dictionaries (please
    refer to <a href="java-language-components.html#tweaking-lexical-data-resources">this
    section in the documentation</a> for more information).
  </p>

  <p>
    In the REST API, all language resources are pulled out from Java JAR files and reside under:
    <code>dcs/web/service/resources</code> path, relative to DCS distribution package.
    To tune the stop words for the English language, for example, you'd modify the
    <code>english.stopwords.utf8</code> file. To tweak corresponding label exclusion dictionaries,
    you'd modify the <code>english.stoplabels.utf8</code> file.
  </p>

  <p class="warning">
    Changes to language resource files are
    not automatically detected (or reloaded): a server restart is required.
