  <h1>Language Components</h1>

  <p>
    In this section we describe means to tune the language component resources in the
    REST API (DCS).
  </p>

  <p>
    The Java API <a href="java-language-components.html">language components section</a>
    already introduced the role and importance of tuning language components properly.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the REST API, all default <a href="dictionaries.html">dictionaries</a> reside under the
    <code>dcs/web/service/resources</code> path, relative to DCS distribution package.
  </p>

  <p class="warning">
    Changes to language resource files are
    not automatically detected or reloaded, a server restart is required for changes to take effect.
  </p>

    <h2>Ephemeral dictionaries</h2>

    <p>
      All Carrot<sup>2</sup> algorithms provide support for
      <a href="java-language-components.html#ephemeral-dictionaries">
      ephemeral dictionaries</a> via the Java API. These dictionaries can be used to provide
      per-request filtering to exclude stop words or cluster labels. This functionality
      is not part of the REST API as such but is a part of each
      algorithm's set of parameters. The parameter is called the same (<code>dictionaries</code>) across
      all algorithms by convention.
    </p>

    <p>
      This example shows a request to the Lingo algorithm utilizing
      both label and word filters to filter out certain undesirable labels:
