  <h1>Hello, Carrot<sup>2</sup>!</h1>

  <p>
    This article is an overview of Carrot<sup>2</sup> and the available resources.
  </p>

  <p>
    Carrot<sup>2</sup> is a programming library for clustering text. It can automatically
    discover groups of related documents and label them with short key terms or phrases.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, it can turn search result titles and snippets into groups
    like these:
  </p>

        and corresponding cluster labels (right).

  <p>
    The process of taking raw text and discovering related documents is called
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis">cluster analysis</a> and
    there are many ways to do it. Carrot<sup>2</sup> provides common infrastructure
    for a few different algorithms so that your code can switch between them at will.
  </p>

  <p>
    Out-of-the-box, Carrot<sup>2</sup> distribution comes with:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>a <a href="java-api-basics.html">Java programming interface</a> (API) and
      <a href="algorithms.html">an implementation of several clustering algorithms</a>,</li>
    <li><a href="rest-api-basics.html">a HTTP/JSON (REST) service</a>
      for mash-ups or integration with languages other than Java,</li>
    <li><a href="../frontend">a simple search-engine-like demo application</a>
      that clusters search results,</li>
    <li>code snippets and examples for reuse in your code.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Additionally, several downstream projects provide integration between Carrot<sup>2</sup>
    and popular document retrieval services:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr</a> has
      <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/8_2/result-clustering.html">built-in
        support</a> for clustering search results via Carrot<sup>2</sup> algorithms,
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/carrot2/elasticsearch-carrot2">elasticsearch-carrot2</a>
      plugin provides search results clustering for
      <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a>.</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>Try Carrot<sup>2</sup> now</h2>

    <p>
      The quickest way to try out Carrot<sup>2</sup> is to use the public
      <a href="https://search.carrot2.org">live demo</a>. This demo lets you
      play with clustering of search results aggregated from many popular
      search engines (courtesy of <a href="https://www.comcepta.com/">Comcepta AG</a>)
      or explore medical documents from the
      <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/">PubMed database</a>
      of medical abstracts.
