  <h1>REST API Basics</h1>

  <p>
    This article will walk you through the methods offered by the Carrot<sup>2</sup> HTTP/REST
    service.
  </p>

  <p>
    Carrot<sup>2</sup> Document Clustering Server (DCS) exposes Carrot<sup>2</sup> clustering
    as a stateless HTTP/REST service. The DCS contains:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        HTTP REST service endpoints for <a href="#clustering">document clustering</a>,
        dynamic inspection of <a href="#service-configuration">service components</a>
        and an <a href="#openapi">OpenAPI descriptor</a>,
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        a search engine-like application for clustering data from public sources,
        such web search results or PubMed abstracts,
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <a href="getting-started.html#clustering-your-own-data">Clustering
          Workbench</a>, a browser-based application for more advanced users
        wishing to cluster content from local files (Excel, CSV, JSON), Solr or
        Elasticsearch engines,
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        a few Java examples that make use of <a href="#models">model classes</a>
        and query the REST API,
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        built-in <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/" target="_blank">Jetty</a> HTTP server,

        this documentation.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In the examples below we will refer to the DCS and the REST service interchangeably, although
    the service application context can be separated and deployed on any other web application
    container, such as <a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat</a>.

    <h2>Installation and running</h2>

    <p>
      To install the Document Clustering Server:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Make sure you have Java 11 or later available in your system.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Download the latest Carrot<sup>2</sup> <a
          href="https://github.com/carrot2/carrot2/releases" target="_blank">release</a>
          and extract the archive to a local folder.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Run the DCS:
        </p>

        <pre data-language="shell">
          $ cd dcs
          $ ./dcs
        </pre>

        <p>
          By default the DCS will bind to port 8080. To change the port number, use
          the <code>--port</code> command line parameter.
        </p>

        <pre data-language="shell">$ dcs --port 8080
09:47:32: DCS context initialized [algorithms: [Bisecting K-Means, Lingo, STC], templates: [frontend-default, lingo, stc, bkmeans]]
09:47:32: Service started on port 8080.
</pre>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Once started, the DCS is ready to accept requests:

    <h2>API workflow</h2>

    <p>
      The document clustering service is a single, stateless endpoint accepting JSON
      requests and returning JSON responses.
    </p>

    <p>
      A full clustering request is a JSON file containing the following elements:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>clustering algorithm identifier,</li>
      <li>language identifier,</li>
      <li>text fields of documents to be clustered.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Such a request file must be sent using HTTP POST method to the <code>/cluster</code>
      service endpoint, which returns either a successful response containing clusters
      or an error response with some additional
      diagnostic information.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the request contains elements that may require some <em>a priori</em> knowledge, such as
      the clustering algorithm's identifier and the language. You can assume
      that certain components, such as the <code>Lingo</code> algorithm or the <code>English</code>
      language, always exist in your DCS distribution. Alternatively, you can
      <a href="#service-configuration">get the available components</a> from the
      <code>/list</code> service endpoint.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="clustering">
    <h2>Clustering</h2>

    <p>
      This section will go through a very basic example of a full
      request-response cycle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's start by assembling the request JSON. We need to know the algorithm to be used
      for clustering and the language in which our documents are written, so that an appropriate
      preprocessing is applied to input text before clustering.
      In this example we will use hardcoded values for the <code>Lingo</code> algorithm
      and the <code>English</code> language.
    </p>

    <p>
      Documents for clustering are composed of one or more fields, where each field is a pair
      consisting of an identifier (name of the field) and value (a string or an array of strings).
      You should limit input documents to just those fields that should be clustered.
      In this example we will have three documents, each with one field:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="./examples/cluster-documents.json"></pre>

    <p>
      We have everything we need to put together the entire request body:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="./examples/cluster-request.json"></pre>

    <p>
      You probably noticed that there is one element in the above request we have not discussed yet:
      the <code>parameters</code> block. This block is used to alter Lingo's default
      settings. Our document list is very tiny and we force the algorithm to produce
      at least one group, so that we can see what it looks like in the response.
    </p>

    <p>
      Assuming the DCS is running in the background, the clustering service's
      default endpoint is at <code>http://localhost:8080/service/cluster</code>.
      We are ready to send the above JSON for clustering using a command-line tool, such as
      <code>curl</code>:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="./examples/cluster-request.sh" data-language="none"></pre>

    <p>
      Note the MIME type for JSON must be properly set (<code>Content-Type: text/json</code>). The
      response received from the service should be something like this:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="./examples/cluster-response.json"></pre>

    <p>
      The response is a potentially recursive hierarchy of document clusters, where each
      cluster has the following properties:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>labels</dt>
      <dd>Cluster description label or labels.</dd>
      <dt>documents</dt>
      <dd>
        An array of references to documents contained in the cluster. Each reference is a 0-based
        index of the document within the clustering request.
      </dd>
      <dt>clusters</dt>
      <dd>An array of subclusters of this cluster (if the algorithm supports hierarchical
        clustering).
      </dd>
      <dt>score</dt>
      <dd>The cluster's quality score. The score is not normalized in any way but represents
        relative quality of each cluster within this request.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      In the response above we see a single cluster of documents <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>,
      labeled <i>Bar</i>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="models">
    <h2>Request and response models</h2>

    <p>
      While it is perfectly fine to assemble the request JSON by hand, the DCS distribution
      comes with data model Java classes that can be used to build request and parse responses.
      The example shown in the previous section can be expressed in Java code by the
      following snippet:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%DCS_EXAMPLES%/E04_DcsDataModels.java"
         data-fragment="build-request"></pre>

    <p>
      The request can be then serialized into JSON using the
      <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson">Jackson</a> library. The DCS Java examples
      contain a few command-line applications that make extensive use of these model classes, please
      refer to them for details.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alternatively, the <a href="#openapi">OpenAPI descriptor</a>
      can be used to generate service binding code for Java and many other languages.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="service-configuration">
    <h2>Service configuration</h2>

    <p>
      The second service endpoint the DCS exposes is called <code>/list</code>. When invoked
      with a single HTTP GET (without any parameters), the service returns information
      on the available algorithms and languages. An example response can
      look like this:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="./examples/list-response.json"></pre>

    <p>
      Note that each algorithm has an associated list of language codes it supports.
      The <code>templates</code> block enumerates preconfigured <a href="dcs-templates.html">request templates </a>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="openapi">
    <h2>OpenAPI service descriptor</h2>

    <p>
      The DCS comes with an <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI</a>
      service specification descriptor, by default accessible at:
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/service/openapi/dcs.yaml">http://localhost:8080/service/openapi/dcs.yaml</a>
      This descriptor contains documentation and working examples for all service endpoints and
      parameters.
    </p>

    <p>
      The DCS ships with three OpenAPI specification browsers:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://localhost:8080/service/openapi/swagger/index.html">Swagger</a> (recommended),</li>
      <li><a href="http://localhost:8080/service/openapi/rapidoc/index.html">RapiDoc</a>,</li>
      <li><a href="http://localhost:8080/service/openapi/redoc/index.html">ReDoc</a>.</li>
    </ul>
