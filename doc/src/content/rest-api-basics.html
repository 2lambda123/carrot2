  <h1>REST API Basics</h1>

  <p>
    This article will walk you through the methods offered by the Carrot<sup>2</sup> HTTP/REST
    service.
  </p>

  <p>
    Carrot<sup>2</sup> comes with a component that offers much of the functionality
    of the Java API as a stateless HTTP/REST service. This service is offered as a web
    application
    context (appropriately called <code>service</code>) and is bundled together with a simple
    search frontend demo application, some additional documentation, and a built-in <a
      href="https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/">Jetty</a> HTTP server inside the Document Clustering
    Server (DCS).
  </p>

  <p>
    In the examples below we will refer to the DCS and the REST service interchangeably, although
    the service application context could in theory be deployed on any other web application
    container (such as <a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat</a>).

    <h2>Installation</h2>

    <p>
      The DCS is shipped with the Carrot<sup>2</sup> distribution under <code>dcs</code> folder.
      It requires <code>java</code> to be installed on the host system and will bind to port
      <code>8080</code> by default. An alternative port can be selected by passing
      <code>--port</code>
      option to the launch script:
    </p>

    <pre data-language="none">&gt; dcs --port 8081
09:47:32: DCS context initialized [algorithms: [Bisecting K-Means, Lingo, STC], templates: [frontend-default, lingo, stc, bkmeans]]
09:47:32: Service started on port 8081.
</pre>

    <p>
      Once started, the service is ready to accept requests (typically at <a href="http://localhost:8080/service/">http://localhost:8080/service/</a>).
