  <h1>Algorithms</h1>

  <p>
    Carrot<sup>2</sup> offers three clustering algorithms of varying characteristics:
    Lingo, STC and bisecting k-means. There is also Lingo3G, a fast highly-tunable
    commercial algorithm that seamlessly integrates with Carrot<sup>2</sup>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each clustering algorithm tackles the problem of identifying groups of related
    documents in a different way. Therefore, for the same input the algorithms will
    produce different clusters and will have different performance characteristics.

  <p>
    For example, compare the following cluster labels produced for the same input (<em>data
    mining</em> search results) by our three clustering algorithms:

        Carrot <sup>2</sup> clustering algorithms.

    There is no single "best" text clustering algorithm. The choice will depend on the
    characteristics and size of the input texts as well as your particular needs and expectations.
    While we provide some general <a href="tuning-quality.html#choosing-the-algorithm">algorithm
    choice advice</a> and <a href="tuning-performance.html">performance tuning hints</a>, you will
    ultimately need to experiment, tweak parameters, and select what fits your data and use case.

    <h2>Lingo algorithm</h2>

    <p>
      The <a href="http://project.carrot2.org/publications/osinski04-dimensionality.pdf">Lingo
      algorithm</a> employs term-document matrix dimensionality reduction techniques to figure
      out the structure of topics present in the input. The algorithm is reasonably fast and nicely
      separates diverse topics into separate groups. This will typically be the default algorithm
      you may want to use.

  <section id="stc">
    <h2>STC algorithm</h2>

    <p>
      The key data structure in the STC algorithm is the Generalized Suffix Tree (GST) built for all
      input documents. The algorithm traverses the GST to identify words and phrases that occurred
      frequently in the input documents and merges sub-groups of documents with high overlap. The
      algorithm is very fast, even for large sets of documents, but suffers from the lack of cluster
      diversity.

  <section id="bisecting-kmeans">
    <h2>Bisecting k-means</h2>

    <p>
      Bisecting k-means is an implementation of a generic cluster analysis technique, contrary to
      Lingo and STC which are text-specific. The algorithm attempts to recursively split
      the documents into smaller and smaller groups until the splits become unfeasible. The
      disadvantage of this algorithm is that it creates single-term labels, which are often subpar
      compared to phrase-based labels produced by STC or Lingo.

  <section id="lingo3g">
    <h2>Lingo3G algorithm</h2>

    <p>
      Lingo3G is a commercial successor to the Lingo algorithm. The algorithm
      offers much higher performance, lower memory consumption and many more tuning options
      compared to Lingo. Please refer to <a href="https://carrotsearch.com/lingo3g/">Carrot Search
      Lingo3G</a> web site for details.
