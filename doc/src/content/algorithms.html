  <h1>Algorithms</h1>

  <p>
    This section lists the algorithms available in Carrot<sup>2</sup>
  </p>

  <p>
    Each clustering algorithm tackles the problem of identifying groups of related
    documents in a slightly different way and comes with different
    performance characteristics (see <a href="tuning-performance.html">tuning
    performance</a> for deeper insight into each algorithm's performance profile).
  </p>

  <p>
    Carrot<sup>2</sup> offers several clustering algorithms to choose from:
    Lingo, STC and a generic bisecting k-means clustering. In addition to these open source
    implementations, a commercial algorithm
    <a href="https://carrotsearch.com/lingo3g/">Lingo3G</a> plugs seamlessly into
    the same open source API. Switching between any of them is trivial.
  </p>

  <p>
    The choice of an algorithm will affect the clustering output but no algorithm is "the best"
    (refer to <a href="tuning-quality.html#choosing-the-algorithm">this section</a> for details).
    Experiment with all of them, tweak parameters, finally select what fits your particular needs
    and expectations. For example,
    compare the following cluster labels acquired for the same query "data mining":

    <h2>Lingo algorithm</h2>

    <p>
      The <a href="http://project.carrot2.org/publications/osinski04-dimensionality.pdf">Lingo
      algorithm</a> employs term-document matrix dimensionality reduction techniques to figure
      out the structure of topics present in the input. The algorithm is reasonably fast and nicely
      separates diverse topics into separate groups. This will typically be the default algorithm
      you may want to use.

  <section id="stc">
    <h2>STC algorithm</h2>

    <p>
      The key data structure in the STC algorithm is the <strong>Suffix Tree</strong> or rather
      a Generalized Suffix Tree (GST) built for all input documents. The algorithm
      traverses the GST to identify words and phrases that occurred frequently in the input
      documents and merges sub-groups of documents with high overlap. The algorithm
      is very fast, even for large sets of documents, but suffers from lack
      of cluster diversity.

  <section id="bisecting-kmeans">
    <h2>Bisecting k-means</h2>

    <p>
      Bisecting k-means is an implementation of a generic cluster-analysis technique (contrary to
      Lingo and STC which are text-specific). The algorithm attempts to recursively split
      the documents into smaller and smaller groups until the splits become unfeasible. The
      disadvantage
      of this algorithm is that the labels it creates are often subpar compared to STC or Lingo
      (they consist of single terms rather than phrases).

    <h2>Lingo3G algorithm</h2>

    <p>
      Lingo3G is a commercial successor to the Lingo algorithm. The algorithm
      offers faster performance, lower memory consumption and many more tuning options
      compared to Lingo. Please refer to <a href="https://carrotsearch.com/lingo3g/">Carrot Search
      Lingo3G</a> web site for details.
