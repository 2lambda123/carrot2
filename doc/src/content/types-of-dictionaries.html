  <h1>Types of dictionaries</h1>

  <p>
    Dictionaries help Carrot<sup>2</sup> to improve the quality of clustering
    for a specific language. This section discusses the available dictionaries and
    ways of tuning them to match the content you cluster.
  </p>

  <p>
    A dictionary defines a set of words or phrases that should be ignored when
    clustering content in a specific language. Carrot<sup>2</sup> comes
    with basic dictionary files for all the supported languages. Additionally,
    you can provide per-request dictionaries in the REST API and configure
    ephemeral dictionaries using Java API.

    <h2>Types of dictionaries</h2>
    
    <p>
      Carrot<sup>2</sup> supports two types of dictionaries:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Word filters</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The set of words that should be ignored during clustering. If a word
          is filtered out, it will not have influence on the cluster the
          algorithm produces, but may still show in cluster labels, such as <em>University
          of Washington</em>, to aid readability.
        </p>

        <p>
          Typically, word filters would contain function words, such as
          <em>of</em> or <em>between</em>.
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt>Label filters</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The set of words or phrases that must not be used as cluster labels.
          You can use label filters to suppress offensive or non-informative
          labels, such as <em>Official website</em>.
        </p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </section>

  <section id="location-of-dictionary-files">
    <h2>Location of dictionary files</h2>

    <p>
      For each language, two dictionary files are available:
    </p>
    
    <dl>
      <dt><em>lang</em>.word-filters.json</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Word filters dictionary for language <em>lang</em>, for example
          <code>english.word-filters.json</code>.
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt><em>lang</em>.label-filters.json</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Label filters dictionary for language <em>lang</em>, for example
          <code>english.label-filters.json</code>.
        </p>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      The location of the dictionary files is different for the Document
      Clustering Server (REST API) and Java API.
    </p>

    <section id="location-of-dictionary-files:document-clustering-server">
      <h3>Document Clustering Server</h3>

      <p>
        The Document Clustering Server reads dictionary files from the
        <code>web/service/resources</code> directory in the server's distribution
        directory.
      </p>

      <p>
        For changes applied to dictionary files to take effect, you need to
        restart the Document Clustering Server.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="location-of-dictionary-files:java-api">
      <h3>Java API</h3>

      <p>
        By default, Carrot<sup>2</sup> Java API will read dictionaries contained in
        <code>carrot2-core-%PROJECT_VERSION%.jar</code> in the
        <code>org/carrot2/language</code>.
