  <h1>REST API Reference</h1>

  <p>
    This page contains links to documentation of all service endpoints and parameters available in
    Carrot<sup>2</sup> REST API.
  </p>

  <p>
    The documentation for the REST API is an integral part of the
    <a href="rest-api-basics.html#openapi">Open API descriptor</a>.
    The documentation of service endpoints, parameters, as well
    as example requests and responses are all part of it.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can
    browse the descriptor
    using one of the viewers provided with the DCS:
    once started, the documentation viewers are listed at
    <a href="http://localhost:8080/service/openapi">http://localhost:8080/service/openapi</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    We recommend <em>Swagger</em>
    because it handles the examples and interactive queries best, even if it lacks in the
    design department.
