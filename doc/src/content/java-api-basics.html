  <h1>Java API Basics</h1>

  <p>
    This article will walk you through the basics of the Carrot<sup>2</sup> Java API.
  </p>


  <section id="dependencies">
    <h2>Dependencies</h2>

    <p>
      Carrot<sup>2</sup> is a Java library (JAR) with artifacts published via
      Maven Central repositories. The following JAR contains the core APIs,
      language resources for English and the clustering algorithms:
    </p>

    <pre data-language="xml"><dependency>
  <groupId>org.carrot2</groupId>
  <artifactId>carrot2-core</artifactId>
  <version>%PROJECT_VERSION%</version>
</dependency></pre>

    <p>
      A corresponding Gradle dependency would look like this:
    </p>

    <pre data-language="groovy">implementation "org.carrot2:carrot2-core:%PROJECT_VERSION%"</pre>

    <p>
      Additional JARs may be required to cluster documents in languages other than English.
      Please refer to <a href="non-english-content.html">this section</a> to see what's needed.
    </p>

    <p>
      A binary Carrot<sup>2</sup> distribution, including all examples, is always available at
      the project's <a href="https://github.com/carrot2/carrot2/releases">GitHub releases page</a>.

  <section id="api-overview">
    <h2>API workflow</h2>

    <p>
      Using Carrot<sup>2</sup> Java API consists of the following steps:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>setting up heavy, thread-safe, reusable components (language dictionaries and auxiliary
        resources),</li>
      <li>setting up lightweight, per-thread components (algorithms),</li>
      <li>preparing input documents and performing actual clustering.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="warning">
      Lightweight components can be created on-demand once the documents are ready so there is
      some room for flexibility. <strong>Make sure to load and instantiate the heavy components
      once</strong>.
    </p>
  </section>


  <section id="example-basics">
    <h2>Clustering</h2>

    <p>
      The following example discusses the code from <code>E01_ClusteringBasics.java</code>
      example. This shows just the key elements required to process a stream of documents
      in English, without any parameter or language resource tuning.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, let's load the default resources for the English language. The
      loaded <code>LanguageComponents</code> instance is thread-safe and should be reused for
      any subsequent calls to clustering algorithms.
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E01_ClusteringBasics.java"
         data-fragment="setup-heavy-components"></pre>

    <p>
      Now it's time to create an instance of a clustering algorithm. Let's pick the Lingo
      algorithm explicitly:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E01_ClusteringBasics.java"
         data-fragment="setup-lightweight-components"></pre>

    <p>
      Once we have the heavy and lightweight components initialized, we can assemble the input (a
      stream of
      <code>Document</code> instances) for clustering. Each document must implement a
      method that presents its clusterable text fields to the algorithm.
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%CORE%/org/carrot2/clustering/Document.java"
         data-fragment="visitor-method"></pre>

    <p>
      In this example we will feed field values from an array of search results contained in the
      <code>ExamplesData</code> class:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/ExamplesData.java"
         data-fragment="search-results-array"></pre>

    <p>
      Because the field visitor interface is a single method it can be implemented using a clusure.
      We convert the above data array into document instances dynamically using java streams
      (note we only map the title and the snippet, the URL is not really suitable for clustering
      so we omit it).
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E01_ClusteringBasics.java"
         data-fragment="clustering-document-stream"></pre>

    <p>
      Everything is now ready to call the clustering algorithm and consume the result;
      we print the top-level cluster labels and document counts to the console:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E01_ClusteringBasics.java"
         data-fragment="clustering"></pre>

    <p>
      When executed, this example should print something like this:
    </p>

    <pre data-language="none">Data Mining Software, documents: 13
Knowledge Discovery, documents: 13
Data Mining Process, documents: 12
Data Mining Applications, documents: 11
Data Mining Techniques, documents: 11</pre>
  </section>

  <section id="tweaking-attributes">
    <h2>Tweaking parameters</h2>

    <p>
      Each clustering algorithm will have a different set of knobs to adjust its behavior.
      All algorithms in Carrot<sup>2</sup> have public fields (documented in the generated JavaDoc
      documentation) that allow direct changes of algorithm's settings. For example:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E02_TweakingAttributes.java"
         data-fragment="parameters"></pre>

    <p>
      Note that even simple attributes (like <code>wordDfThreshold</code> above) have to use
      setter methods to modify their value. This is because arguments are validated early and
      values out of range (or otherwise incorrect) will trigger exceptions at the exact moment they
      are set in the code.
    </p>

    <p>
      When an attribute is of a complex type (is an interface), the concrete type variable can
      be declared and configured prior to setting the final attribute:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E02_TweakingAttributes.java"
         data-fragment="complex-parameters"></pre>

    <p>
      Once an algorithm is configured it can be reused across many subsequent (sequential)
      clustering calls. The <a href="multithreading.html">multithreading section</a> discusses
      approaches to running algorithms in concurrent threads.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="enumerating-components">
    <h2>Enumerating components dynamically</h2>

    <p>
      Carrot<sup>2</sup> components (algorithms, languages) are implemented as
      service extension points. While they can be referenced directly with explicit class
      names (like the <code>LingoClusteringAlgorithm</code> in examples above) we can also
      enumerate and inspect their properties dynamically.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, the following code enumerates
      all available algorithm providers, checks if the given algorithm supports the English language
      and clusters (the same) stream of documents repeatedly.
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E01_ClusteringBasics.java"
         data-fragment="algorithm-enumeration"></pre>

    <p>
      A similar service extension point exists for language component providers, this time
      with a facade method simplifying enumeration of available languages even further:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E03_CustomLanguageComponents.java"
         data-fragment="language-enumeration"></pre>
