  <h1>Language Components</h1>

  <p>
    In this section we describe the role and potential customisation options for language-specific
    heavyweight components.
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>LanguageComponent</code> instances provide assistance and hints to improve the
    quality of clustering for a specific language. The resources associated with this task
    typically require costly processing to load and parse, so <code>LanguageComponent</code>
    instances should be <strong>created early and reused for all subsequent clustering
    calls</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    A single <code>LanguageComponent</code> instance can provide a number of resources to aid
    the algorithm in improving clustering quality:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>lemmatisation (stemming) routines,</li>
    <li>tokenisation (word decomposition) and decompounding routines,</li>
    <li>part of speech dictionaries,</li>
    <li>ignore lists (stop word lists).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The above list is not restricted or complete: each algorithm may require
    a different set of components to function properly and each language will have a specific set
    of components that makes sense for that particular language. All available languages
    and their provided components (interfaces) can be enumerated via service point extension,
    as shown below.
  </p>

  <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E03_CustomLanguageComponents.java"
       data-fragment="component-enumeration"></pre>

  <p>
    The code above prints the following when executed, revealing interfaces of components
    provided by the default provider for English (other languages omitted):
  </p>

  <pre data-language="none">Provider class: Carrot2 (English, Danish, Dutch, [...]
  > English
    Component: org.carrot2.language.Stemmer
    Component: org.carrot2.language.Tokenizer
    Component: org.carrot2.language.LexicalData
    Component: org.carrot2.text.preprocessing.LabelFormatter
  [...]</pre>

  <p>
    Each of the interfaces of a language component can be
    overridden. However, for the vast majority of applications
    only minor tweaks to the defaults are really needed. For example, adding ignorable
    terms and phrases specific to a given domain is a very helpful step
    to increase clustering quality
    (patent documents will have a different lexicon compared to an unrestricted e-mail corpus, for example).
    Let's take a look at how this is done first.
  </p>

  <div class="warning">
    <strong>Some algorithms may not support all languages</strong>

    <p>
      Clustering algorithms may support a subset of languages and language component instances
      assembled
      manually. Each clustering algorithm has a method called <code>supports(LanguageComponents
      lc)</code>
      which can be used to check whether the algorithm works with a given instance of language
      components.
    </p>
  </div>

  <section id="tweaking-lexical-data-resources">
    <h2>Tweaking lexical data resources</h2>

    <p>
      The <code>LexicalData</code> component is responsible
      for telling the algorithm whether a term or a candidate cluster
      label should be ignored. Such ignorable elements typically include function
      words like prepositions, conjunctions or domain-specific boilerplate language that
      is not a good candidate for a cluster.
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%CORE%/org/carrot2/language/LexicalData.java"
         data-fragment="lexical-data"></pre>

    <p>
      The most common quality tuning step is modifying the
      resources provided for the <code>LexicalData</code> component's
      default implementation (<code>LexicalDataImpl</code>). This class
      attempts to load two files (where the <i>lang</i> prefix is replaced with the
      name of the language the component is instantiated for):
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><i>lang</i>.stopwords.utf8</dt>
      <dd>
        A plain-text list of words to ignore. Each line contains exactly one full word (token).
        Something like the following:
        <pre>a
about
above
across
...</pre>
      </dd>

      <dt><i>lang</i>.stoplabels.utf8</dt>
      <dd>
        A plain-text list of Java regular expression patterns to ignore. Each line contains exactly
        one expression that, if it matches the input label, causes the label to be discarded and
        ignored during clustering. An example stop labels file could look like this:
        <pre>(?i)information (about|on).*
(?i)(index|list) of.*
...</pre>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      The <code>LanguageComponentsLoader</code> class has methods to restrict
      the number of loaded resources to only cover the needed languages (and/ or algorithms). There
      is also a method for adding custom <code>ResourceLookup</code> implementation, responsible
      for locating any external resources components may require.
      We can load our custom, modified resources using this facility without
      touching any of the default components. It's a good idea to start tweaking custom resources
      by first copying the defaults from Carrot<sup>2</sup> JARs and then modifying them in
      the new location.
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E03_CustomLanguageComponents.java"
         data-fragment="custom-english-resources"></pre>

    <p>
      Once loaded, the <code>LanguageComponents</code> object is ready to be used for subsequent
      clustering calls.

    <h2>Tweaking components directly</h2>

    <p>
      It may be sometimes desirable to provide an entirely custom implementation of a given
      preprocessing component. An instance of <code>LanguageComponents</code> class consists
      of a set of components (interfaces) and suppliers providing implementations of these
      interfaces. We can override any of these suppliers, creating a custom language preprocessing
      pipeline.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an example, let's modify the English pipeline to use a custom word stemming component.
      The supplier for this component always returns the same closure, converting the input to lower
      case:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E03_CustomLanguageComponents.java"
         data-fragment="custom-stemmer"></pre>

    <p>
      We will also replace the default <code>LexicalData</code> implementation with simple custom
      filtering based on hardcoded rules:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E03_CustomLanguageComponents.java"
         data-fragment="custom-lexical-data"></pre>

    <p>
      Note how the initialization of the <code>ignored</code> set is pulled out of the supplier.
      The cost of setting up a heavy component (the supplier itself here) can be high but
      once set up, suppliers should return instances of a given component quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once we have custom suppliers, overriding their default implementations
      for English is trivial:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E03_CustomLanguageComponents.java"
         data-fragment="custom-overrides"></pre>

  <section id="other-languages">
    <h2>Support for other languages</h2>

    <p>
      The core Carrot<sup>2</sup> JAR supports only a limited set of popular languages.
      Additional modules add support for other languages and bring in extra resources required
      for these languages to work properly.
    </p>

    <p>
      All language extensions live under the <code>org.carrot2.lang</code> artifact
      group namespace. Note that many of them come with sizeable
      own dependencies like <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">Apache Lucene</a>
      analyzers or dictionaries.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>carrot2-lang-lucene-chinese</code>: Chinese (traditional
        and simplified).
      </li>
      <li><code>carrot2-lang-lucene-japanese</code>: Japanese.</li>
      <li><code>carrot2-lang-lucene-korean</code>: Korean.</li>
      <li><code>carrot2-lang-lucene</code>: adds support for many other languages
        supported by the <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">Apache Lucene</a> project.
      </li>
      <li><code>carrot2-lang-polish</code>: Polish.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A language extension is automatically added to the list of supported language components if
      it can be located and loaded by Java's standard <code>ServiceLoader</code>.
