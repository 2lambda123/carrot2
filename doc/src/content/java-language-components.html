  <h1>Language Components</h1>

  <p>
    In this section we describe the role and potential customisation options for language-specific
    heavyweight components.
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>LanguageComponent</code> instances provide assistance and hints to improve the
    quality of clustering for a specific language. The resources associated with this task
    typically require costly processing to load and parse, so <code>LanguageComponent</code>
    instances should be <strong>created early and reused for all subsequent clustering
    calls</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    A single <code>LanguageComponent</code> instance can provide a number of resources to aid
    the algorithm in improving clustering quality:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>lemmatisation (stemming) routines,</li>
    <li>tokenisation (word decomposition) and decompounding routines,</li>
    <li>part of speech dictionaries,</li>
    <li>ignore lists (stop word lists).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The above list is not restricted or complete: each algorithm may require
    a different set of components to function properly and each language will have a specific set
    of components that makes sense for that particular language. All available languages
    and their provided components (interfaces) can be enumerated via service point extension,
    as shown below.
  </p>

  <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E03_CustomLanguageComponents.java"
       data-fragment="component-enumeration"></pre>

  <p>
    The code above prints the following when executed, revealing providers
    and components supplied for the English language (other languages omitted):
  </p>

  <pre data-language="none">  > English
    [Provider: Carrot2 Core (Stemmers)]
      Component: org.carrot2.language.Stemmer
    [Provider: Carrot2 Core (Tokenizers)]
      Component: org.carrot2.language.Tokenizer
    [Provider: Carrot2 Core (Lexical Data)]
      Component: org.carrot2.language.LabelFilter
      Component: org.carrot2.language.StopwordFilter
    [Provider: Carrot2 Core (Label Formatter)]
      Component: org.carrot2.text.preprocessing.LabelFormatter
  [...]</pre>

  <p>
    Each of the interfaces of a language component can be
    overridden. However, for the vast majority of applications
    only minor tweaks to the defaults are really needed. For example, adding ignorable
    terms and phrases specific to a given domain is a very helpful step
    to increase clustering quality
    (patent documents will have a different lexicon compared to an unrestricted e-mail corpus, for example).
    Let's take a look at how this is done first.
  </p>

  <div class="warning">
    <strong>Some algorithms may not support all languages</strong>

    <p>
      Clustering algorithms may support a subset of languages and language component instances
      assembled
      manually. Each clustering algorithm has a method called <code>supports(LanguageComponents
      lc)</code>
      which can be used to check whether the algorithm works with a given instance of language
      components.
    </p>
  </div>

  <section id="tweaking-lexical-data-resources">
    <h2>Tweaking lexical data resources</h2>

    <p>
      Lexical components are responsible for telling the algorithm whether a term or a candidate cluster
      label should be ignored. Such ignorable elements typically include function
      words like prepositions, conjunctions or domain-specific boilerplate language that
      is not a good candidate for a cluster.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code>StopwordFilter</code> interface controls low-level filtering
      of individual terms:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%CORE%/org/carrot2/language/StopwordFilter.java"
         data-fragment="word-filter"></pre>

    <p>
      The <code>LabelFilter</code> interface controls low-level filtering
      of undesired cluster labels.
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%CORE%/org/carrot2/language/LabelFilter.java"
         data-fragment="label-filter"></pre>

    <p>
      While both these components can be explicitly provided (or overriden) in a <code>LanguageData</code>
      instance, the easiest and most common quality tuning step is to modify the
      default implementation's existing text resources. Carrot<sup>2</sup> attempts to load
      two files for each language (where the <i>lang</i> prefix is replaced with the
      name of the language the component is instantiated for):
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><i>lang</i>.stopwords.utf8</dt>
      <dd>
        A plain-text list of words to ignore. Each line contains exactly one word (token).
        Entries in this dictionary are applied to tokens after case normalization and should be
        lowercased, for example:
        <pre>a
about
above
across
...</pre>
      </dd>

      <dt><i>lang</i>.stoplabels.utf8</dt>
      <dd>
        A plain-text list of regular expression patterns to ignore. Patterns
        should be compatible with Java Pattern class specification. Each line contains exactly
        one expression that, if it matches the input label, causes the label to be discarded and
        ignored during clustering. Both the patterns and label candidates passed for matching
        are case-sensitive. Case-insensitive patterns can be created with local pattern flags
        as shown in the example stop labels file below:
        <pre>(?i)information (about|on).*
(?i)(index|list) of.*
...</pre>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      The <code>LanguageComponentsLoader</code> class has methods to restrict
      the number of loaded resources to only cover the needed languages (and/ or algorithms). There
      is also a method for adding custom <code>ResourceLookup</code> implementation, responsible
      for locating any external resources components may require.
      We can load our custom, modified resources using this facility without
      touching any of the default components. It's a good idea to start tweaking custom resources
      by first copying the defaults from Carrot<sup>2</sup> JARs and then modifying them in
      the new location.
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E03_CustomLanguageComponents.java"
         data-fragment="custom-english-resources"></pre>

    <p>
      Once loaded, the <code>LanguageComponents</code> object is ready to be used for subsequent
      clustering calls.
    </p>

  <section id="tweaking-ephemeral-dictionaries">
    <h2>Ephemeral dictionaries (lexical filters)</h2>

    <p>
      When labels and stop words change frequently from request to request, reloading
      a full set of lexical resources would be slow and impractical. Ephemeral dictionaries
      (per-request filters) are compiled for each clustering call and layered on top
      of the default language data. Please note that this adds some additional cost to each
      clustering call.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the following example, the clustering algorithm uses the default language data for
      English but adds request-specific regular patterns to exclude undesirable labels:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E03_CustomLanguageComponents.java"
         data-fragment="use-ephemeral-dictionary"></pre>
  </section>

  <section id="tweaking-components-directly">
    <h2>Tweaking components directly</h2>

    <p>
      When the default dictionaries fall short of requirements, a custom implementation of a given
      preprocessing component may be required. An <code>LanguageComponents</code> instance consists
      of a set of interfaces and suppliers providing implementations of these
      interfaces. We can override any of these suppliers, creating a custom language preprocessing
      pipeline.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an example, let's modify the English pipeline to use a custom word stemming component.
      The supplier for this component always returns the same closure, converting the input to lower
      case:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E03_CustomLanguageComponents.java"
         data-fragment="custom-stemmer"></pre>

    <p>
      We will also replace the default <code>StopwordFilter</code> and <code>LabelFilter</code> components
      with custom filters based on hardcoded rules:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E03_CustomLanguageComponents.java"
         data-fragment="custom-lexical-data"></pre>

    <p>
      Note how the initialization of the <code>ignored</code> hash set is pulled out of the supplier.
      The cost of setting up a heavy component (creating the hash set itself in this case) can be high but
      once set up, suppliers should return instances of the component quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once we have custom suppliers, overriding their default implementations
      for English is trivial:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E03_CustomLanguageComponents.java"
         data-fragment="custom-overrides"></pre>
  </section>

  <section id="other-languages">
    <h2>Support for other languages</h2>

    <p>
      The core Carrot<sup>2</sup> JAR supports only a limited set of popular languages.
      Additional modules add support for other languages and bring in extra resources required
      for these languages to work properly.
    </p>

    <p>
      All language extensions live under the <code>org.carrot2.lang</code> artifact
      group namespace. Note that many of them come with sizeable
      own dependencies like <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">Apache Lucene</a>
      analyzers or dictionaries.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>carrot2-lang-lucene-chinese</code>: Chinese (traditional
        and simplified).
      </li>
      <li><code>carrot2-lang-lucene-japanese</code>: Japanese.</li>
      <li><code>carrot2-lang-lucene-korean</code>: Korean.</li>
      <li><code>carrot2-lang-lucene</code>: adds support for many other languages
        supported by the <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">Apache Lucene</a> project.
      </li>
      <li><code>carrot2-lang-polish</code>: Polish.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A language extension is automatically added to the list of supported language components if
      it can be located and loaded by Java's standard <code>ServiceLoader</code>.
