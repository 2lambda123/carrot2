  <h1>Choosing algorithm</h1>

  <p>
    Carrot<sup>2</sup> offers two specialized search results clustering
    algorithms: Lingo and STC as well the generic bisecting k-means clustering. This article
    describes briefly the algorithms and provides some recommendations for
    choosing the most suitable one.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>Lingo algorithm</strong> reverses the
    traditional clustering pipeline: it first identifies cluster labels and only
    then assigns documents to the labels to form final clusters. To find the
    labels, Lingo builds a term-document matrix for all input documents and
    decomposes the matrix to obtain a number of base vectors that well
    approximate the matrix in a low-dimensional space. Each such vector gives
    rise to one cluster label. To complete the clustering process, each label is
    assigned documents that contain the label's words.

    The key data structure used in the <strong>Suffix Tree Clustering</strong> (STC) algorithm is
    a Generalized Suffix Tree (GST) built for all input documents. The algorithm
    traverses the GST to identify words and phrases that occurred more than once
    in the input documents. Each such word or phrase gives rise to one base
    cluster. The last stage of the clustering process is merging base clusters
    to form the final clusters.
  </p>

  <p>
    The two algorithms have two features in common. They both create overlapping
    clusterings, in which one document can be assigned to more than one cluster.
    Also, in case of both algorithms a certain number of documents can remain
    unclustered and fall in the <em>Other topics</em> group.
  </p>

  <p>
    Bisecting k-means is a generic clustering algorithm that can also be applied
    to clustering textual data. As opposed to Lingo and STC, bisecting k-means
    creates non-overlapping clusters and does not produce the <em>Other Topics</em>
    group. Its current limitation is that it labels clusters using individual
    words and not all cluster's documents may correspond to the words included
    in the cluster label.
