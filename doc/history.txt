Version  [C] Information

HEAD
          +  STC clustering component refactored. Adopted for the local pipeline 
             (tokenizer, case normalization). Remote version uses embedded local
             controller.

          o  Added 'identity' XSLT argument to carrot2-input-xml.

          #  YahooAPI input occasionally threw an exception due to incorrect result from Yahoo.
             A workaround is not to throw an exception at all -- YahooAPI isn't stable enough to
             rely on it. 

1.0          We're putting a label on the, otherwise stable for a long time, code. Release 1.0
             also brings a refactored local demo/tuning application and several minor technical
             enhancements.
