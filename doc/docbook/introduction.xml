  <subtitle>What is &PROD; and what it is not</subtitle>

  <para>
    &PROD; is a library and a set of supporting applications you can use to build
    a search results clustering engine. Such an engine will <emphasis
    role="bold">organize your search results into topics</emphasis>, fully
    automatically and without external kowledge such as taxonomies or
    preclassified content.
  </para>

  <para>
    &PROD; contains components for fetching search results from several search
    engines, such as Yahoo!, MSN Live, Google, but it also supports other
    sources of documents like Lucene, Solr or Google Desktop index. &PROD;
    contains also two document clustering algorighms designed specifically for
    search results clustering: Suffix Tree Clustering and Lingo.
  </para>

  <para>
    &PROD; <emphasis role="bold">is not a search engine</emphasis> itself, it
    does not have a crawler and indexer. There is a number of Open Source projects
    you can use to crawl (<link xlink:href="http://lucene.apache.org/nutch/">Nutch</link>), 
    index and search (<link xlink:href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</link>, 
    <link xlink:href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</link>) your content, which
    can then be queried and clustered by &PROD;

    &PROD; architecture and internals, while <xref linkend="chapter.components"
