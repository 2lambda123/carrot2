  <subtitle>What is &C2; and what it is not</subtitle>

  <para>
    &C2; is a library and a set of supporting applications you can use to build
    a search results clustering engine. Such an engine will <emphasis
    role="bold">organize your search results into topics</emphasis>, fully
    automatically and without external kowledge such as taxonomies or
    preclassified content.
  </para>

  <para>
    &C2; contains component for fetching search results from several search
    engines, such as Yahoo!, MSN Live, Google, but it also supports other
    sources of documents like Lucene, Solr or Google Desktop index. &C2;
    contains two document clustering algorighms designed specifically for
    search results clustering: Suffix Tree Clustering and Lingo.

    <title>&C2; application suite</title>

    <para>
      &C2; comes with a number of supporting applications that you can use to tune
      clustering results and expose &C2; clustering through different protocols.

          <para>
            You can use &DCW; to experiment with &C2; clustering using data from common search
            engines or your own data. &DCW; allows you to tune the clustering algorithm
            attributes and see how the results change in real time.
