  <para>
    This chapter answers the questions most frequently asked on &C2; mailing lists. As
    it extensively links to further sections of the manual, it can also be treated as some
    sort question-based index for this manual.

            <para>
              No. &C2; can add clustering of search results to an existing search engine. 
              You can use an Open Source project called Nutch to crawl your website. Nutch 
              has a &C2;-based search clustering plugin, so you'll get all crawling, 
              searching and clustering in one piece.

          <answer>
            <para>
              Absolutely. &C2; came about as a framework for building search results 
              clustering engines but its algorithms should successfully cluster up to 
              about a thousand text documents, a few paragraphs each.

          <question>
            <para>How does &C2; clustering scale with respect to the number and length of documents?</para>
          </question>
          <answer>
            <para>
              The most important characteristic of &PROD; algorithms to keep in mind is
              that they perform in-memory clustering. For this reason, as a rule of
              thumb, &PROD; should successfully deal with up to a thousand of
              documents, a few paragraphs each. For algorithms designed to process
              millions of documents, you may want to check out the 
              <link xlink:href="http://lucene.apache.org/mahout/">Mahout</link> project.

          <question>
            <para>Can I force &C2; to cluster my documents to some predefined clusters / labels?</para>
          </question>
          <answer>
            <para>
              No. Assigning documents to a set of predefined categories is a problem 
              called text classification / categorization and &C2; was not designed 
              to solve it. For text classification components you may want to see

            <para>
              Occasionally, &C2; may create meaningless cluster labels like
