  In most cases your workflow with &PROD; would be the following:

  <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Use <link linkend="section.workbench">&DCW;</link> and possibly other applications from &PROD; application suite
        to see what the clustering results are like for your content.  If the
        results are promising, you can use the &DCW; to further tune the
        clustering algorithm's settings.

        If developing Java software, use &PROD; API and JAR to integrate
        clustering into your code.  For non-Java environments, set-up the <link linkend="section.dcs">&DCS;</link>
        and call &C2; clustering using the REST protocol.
