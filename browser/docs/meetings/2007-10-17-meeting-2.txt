    read release plan for Carrot2 version 3.0/ think of improvements/ alternative solutions
    try to write an offline clustering example (Yahoo! -> STC -> console)
    - check offline (batch) plugin compilation possibilities from ANT. This is supposedly HARD. Just find out how hard it is,
    if it's indeed next to impossible, we'll try to figure out something else.
