1) own extention point - done
notes:
- interfaces or superclasses required to add extension should be in their own package: this package will be set visible from outside of the plugin

2) extension to this extension point from other plugin - done
notes:
- simple

3) find a way to use carrot jars in plugins
notes:

- adds META-INF/MANIFEST.MF and build.properties (I don't know if thats a problem or no)

4) update mechanism
5) ANT compilation
