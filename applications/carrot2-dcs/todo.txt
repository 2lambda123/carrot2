TODO:

Must have before release:

* disabling HTML interface and non-clustering endpoints
* DCS front-end (status) available only from listed hosts?
* option to suppress passing internal-configuration attributes? May be useful in public deployments.
* when started by DcsApp, read resources and config from a local directory?
* "refresh" link on the status page
* gzip filter
* pass the "search application mode" option to the filter
* support for branding (icons, algorithms, sources)

* Improve FoamTree hover/selection visibility on white backgrounds
* Tuning of default FoamTree colors
* Breadcrumbs?
* FoamTree interaction hints
* IE 8: disable FoamTree
* Fallback message for legacy browsers
* settings dialog for common parameters (language, safe search)
* handling of Bing limits exceeded
* detailed Google analytics
* keyboard shortcuts for source tab switching
* Prefetching of first N results
* document settings in index.html so that others can customize them
* Error handling, after CORS is implemented
* Redirections for legacy GET URLs

* IndeedDocumentSource --> click vs. view URLs?
* Add site search support to eTools
* Optionally display secondary cluster labels

Nice to have:

* support for FoamTree Flash fallback?
* BUG: FoamTree looks blurry on FF (container sizing problem?)
* support for JSON data on input
* far future expires filter + asset versioning
* JavaScript/CSS minification
* CSS sprites
* support "open link in new tab" case?
* lazy loading of visualization plugin dependencies
* Fading out/in when switching from startup to results screen?
* Highlighting of query/label terms in snippets (in JavaScript, no stemming/synonyms support)
* carrot2.webapp.clusters should notify controller of widtch change rather than do it on its own
* Loading screen delay threshold (show after 150ms or so)
* Optimization: changing of algorithm should not reload documents view


DONE:

* set default parameter values, default source and algorithm
* support for custom attributes
* max document count?
* support for JSON callbacks
* soft error reporting (missing parameters)
* verbose logging (queries, methods)
* implement status tab
* query rate limiting
* BUG: selection of the number of results stopped working
* BUG: font does not embed correcly when loading local (debug) data for the first time


* FoamTree resize hook (only when visualization visible)
* Loading indicator
* BUG: Circles gets reloaded on view switches (Chrome)
* BUG: Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLObjectElement> has no method 'loadDataFromXML' on new query after switching views (Chrome)
* expose searcher function to the outside to enable other backends (Solr, Elastic Search)
* Persistent URLs
* Clickable startup and results logos
* expose document templates, per-source customization of templates (images)
* embedded client-side webapp, possibility to make it the default page?
* redirect to index.html or even better -- serve it from the root URL
* disable "Cluster" button when input is invalid
