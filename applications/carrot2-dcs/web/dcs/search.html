<div style="overflow: hidden">
  <p>
    DCS comes with a simple <a href="webapp/?preview" target="_blank"><img style="float: right; margin-left: 15px" src="assets/img/search-app-preview.jpg" class="img-polaroid" />
    client-side search application</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you'd like to use the search application in a production environment, it is recommended to deploy the DCS
    in the search application mode. In such a configuration, the quick-start front-end you are seeing now will be disabled
    and the search application will become the default front-end served from the root URI.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To start the DCS in the search application mode:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Start the DCS with the <code>--search-application</code> option</li>
    <li>FIXME: instructions for WAR deployments</li>
  </ul>
