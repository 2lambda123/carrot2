How to put some stress on the webapp?

- Extract sample queries from Carrot2 logs:

extract-queries.rb /path/to/logs/c2-logs* | sort -u | shuf > queries

- Edit the replay script and define algorithms and sources you wish
  to involve in the stress test (some of them perhaps should be spared so that
  we don't put too much traffic on the shoulders of smaller search engines)

vi stress.rb

- Run the replay script, piping queries pool to pick from.

cat queries | ./stress.rb -t 5 -m 5

(see ./stress.rb -h for help)
