<h1>Return verbatim query</h1>
<p>
This is an Input type component for Carrot<sup>2</sup>, which returns the query as
a result (identical string). This can be used for filter or output module testing
to force some specific input data set on them.
</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> Identical string means, you must ensure the result is compatible with the components further
down the processing chain, otherwise an error will occur (but hey, maybe it's what you want :).
