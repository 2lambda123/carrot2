        <p>
        <carrot-text/> is a research framework for experimenting with automated querying of
        various data sources (such as search engines), processing search results and
        their visualization.
        </p><p>
        Under the term &quot;research&quot;, we understand that the architecture
        of the system is oriented mostly toward flexibility, sometimes at
        a price of performance losses. Mechanisms such as
        data exchange via XML language, dynamically loaded components
        accessible via HTTP protocol, the use of Java as primary language
        of implementation -- they all make the system very easy to tailor
        to one's needs.
        </p><p>
        <carrot-text/> was primarily built with search results clustering in mind, but it can
        be easily configured to do other, interesting things.
