                The first version of Carrot was originally written by Dawid Weiss.
                It has evolved from a pretty closed search results clustering system
                into an open, modular framework for pipelined data processing. These changes were
                significant enough to justify the change of project's name to
                <carrot-text/>. Currently the core development is performed by Dawid Weiss and
                Stanisław Osiński, although many other contributions have been added to the project (thanks!).

                <p>Carrot is mainly written in Java programming language, because of it's great flexibility
                and numerous supporting technologies. Carrot also uses several open source projects -- we would
                like to thank all the contributors and supporters of free and open source software.</p>
