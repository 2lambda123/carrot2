        <title>Nightly builds</title>
        
        <p>
        Nightly snapshots of <carrot-text /> are available at:
        <a href="http://carrot.cs.put.poznan.pl">http://carrot.cs.put.poznan.pl</a>. Because
        nightly snapshots are what they are (automatic checkouts from the CVS), this site may be down
        or during a failed run (although it happens very rarely).

    <chapter level="1">
        <title>Stable (more or less) builds</title>
        
        <p>
        <carrot-text/> is meant to be a server-side or embedded component, so there are no "releases" per-se. However,
        we provide stable demos and previews (in the SourceForge's File area).
