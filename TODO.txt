
- add better error support (perhaps structured json response) and logging
- add better validation of extra/ unused/ invalid json entries in parameters; handle response.

- DCS: the frontend should have real source(s) (ETools) and switch between available clustering 
  service templates (?)

- Add checkstyle, header license checks?

- TODOs and performance optimizations.
- documentation [another project/ dcs context?]

- Add an IT that verifies what happens if we saturate the server with requests.
- Add proper "distribution" subproject to assemble the DCS and Java examples (?).
